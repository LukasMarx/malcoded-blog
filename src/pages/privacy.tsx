              protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or on
              grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member
              State, other than their storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance
              with the above conditions, users will be informed by the person
              responsible before the restriction is lifted.

            <h3>4. Right to cancellation</h3>
            <h4>a) Duty to delete</h4>
            <p>
              Users may request the data controller to delete personal data
              concerning them immediately and the controller is obliged to
              delete such data immediately if one of the following reasons
              applies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (1) Personal data relating to users are no longer necessary for
                the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise
                processed.
              </li>
              <li>
                (2) Users revoke their consent on which the processing was based
                pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a
                DSBER, and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
              </li>
              <li>
                (3) Users file an objection to processing pursuant to Art. 21
                para. 1 EU-GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds
                for processing, or they file an objection to processing pursuant
                to Art. 21 para. 2 EU-GDPR.
              </li>
              <li>
                (4) Personal data relating to users have been processed
                unlawfully.
              </li>
              <li>
                (5). The deletion of personal data relating to users shall be
                necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under Union law or the
                law of the Member States to which the controller is subject.
              </li>
              <li>
                (6) Personal data relating to users have been collected in
                relation to information society services offered pursuant to
                Art. 8 para. 1 EU-GDPR.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>b) Information to third parties</h4>
            <p>
              If the data controller has made personal data relating to users
              public and is obliged to delete them pursuant to Art. 17 para. 1
              EU-GDPR, he shall take appropriate measures, including technical
              measures, taking into account the available technology and the
              implementation costs, to inform those responsible for data
              processing who process the personal data that you as the data
              subject have requested the deletion of all links to this personal
              data or of copies or replications of this personal data.
            </p>
            <h4>c) Exceptions</h4>
            <p>
              The right to cancellation does not exist insofar as the processing
              is necessary
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>(1) to exercise freedom of expression and information;</li>
              <li>
                (2) for the performance of a legal obligation required for
                processing under the law of the Union or of the Member States to
                which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task
                in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                conferred on the controller;
              </li>
              <li>
                (3) for reasons of public interest in the field of public health
                pursuant to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h and i and Art. 9 para. 3
                EU-GDPR;
              </li>
              <li>
                (4) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
                historical research purposes or for statistical purposes
                pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1 EU-GDPR, insofar as the law referred
                to under a) is likely to make it impossible or seriously impair
                the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or
              </li>
              <li>(5) to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. Right to information</h3>
            <p>
              If users have exercised their right of rectification, cancellation
              or restriction of the processing with respect to the controller,
              the controller shall be obliged to notify all recipients to whom
              personal data relating to the users have been disclosed of such
              rectification or cancellation of the data or restriction of the
              processing, unless this proves impossible or involves
              disproportionate effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users have the right vis-√†-vis the person responsible to be
              informed about these recipients.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>
              Users have the right to receive personally identifiable
              information they provide to the controller in a structured, common
              and machine-readable format. In addition, users have the right to
              transfer this data to another person without hindrance by the
              person responsible for providing the personal data, provided that
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (1) the processing on a consent acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
                or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a EU-GDPR or on a contract acc. Art. 6
                para. 1 lit. b EU-GDPR is based and
              </li>
              <li>(2) the processing is done by automated means.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In exercising this right, users also have the right to obtain that
              personal data relating to them be transmitted directly from one
              controller to another, where technically feasible. Freedoms and
              rights of other persons may not be affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of
              personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the
              public interest or in the exercise of official authority delegated
              to the controller.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Right to object</h3>
            <p>
              Users have the right, for reasons of their own special
              circumstances, to object at any time to the processing of personal
              data relating to you pursuant to Article 6 (1) (e) or (f) of the
              GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The controller will no longer process personal data concerning
              users unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
              processing that outweigh their interests, rights and freedoms, or
              the processing is intended to assert, exercise or defend legal
              claims.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the personal data relating to the users is processed in order
              to operate direct mail, users have the right to object at any time
              to the processing of the personal data concerning them for the
              purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling
              insofar as it is associated with such direct mail.
            </p>
            <p>
              If users object to the processing for direct marketing purposes,
              the personal data concerned will no longer be processed for these
              purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users have the option, in the context of the use of information
              society services, of exercising their right of opposition through
              automated procedures that use technical specifications, regardless
              of Directive 2002/58 / EC.
            </p>
            <h3>
              8. Right to revoke the data protection declaration of consent
            </h3>
            <p>
              Users have the right to revoke their data protection declaration
              of consent at any time. The revocation of consent shall not affect
              the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the
              consent until revocation.
            </p>
            <h3>
              9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling
            </h3>
            <p>
              Users have the right not to be subject to a decision based
              exclusively on automated processing - including profiling - which
              has legal effect against them or significantly impairs them in a
              similar manner. This does not apply if the decision
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract
                between them and the person responsible,
              </li>
              <li>
                (2) the legislation of the Union or of the Member States to
                which the person responsible is subject is admissible and that
                legislation contains appropriate measures to safeguard their
                rights, freedoms and legitimate interests; or
              </li>
              <li>(3) with their express consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of
              personal data pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 EU-GDPR, unless Art. 9
              para. 2 lit. a or g EU-GDPR applies and appropriate measures have
              been taken to protect your rights and freedoms and your legitimate
              interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the person responsible
              shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and
              freedoms and their legitimate interests, including at least the
              right to obtain the intervention of a person by the person
              responsible, to state his own position and to challenge the
              decision.
            </p>
            <h3>10. Right of appeal to a supervisory authority</h3>
            <p>
              Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy,
              users have the right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in
              particular in the Member State where they reside, work or suspect
              of infringement, if they consider that the processing of personal
              data concerning them is contrary to the EU-GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged
              shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the
              complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under
              Article 78 EU-GDPR.
