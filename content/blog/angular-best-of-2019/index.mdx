The year 2019 is almost over...

As every year (for the last 3 years now... wow) I collected the atricles and blog posts about Angular I enjoyed the most.

Thank you to the whole Angular community for creating the great content!

I would also like to thank the loyal readers of this blog. Some of you were there from the beginning and have supported me since then. Thank you very much, have a Merry Christmas and have a Happy New Year!
