The year 2018 is coming to an end...

That time went by quite quickly, didn't it?

It was a very exciting year to be an angular developer. There was not only one, but there were two major framework (6 & 7) releases!

But not only the guys from the angular team were busy. The community did a great job writing amazing and informative content, as well.

In fact, you could argue, that they wrote to much to keep up reading.

That is why I collected the 50 articles and blog-posts, that I personally enjoyed the most. So you don't miss the great reads those guys created for us.

This list is not a competition though. There is no first or last place. They are all a great contribution to the angular community. Especially those articles, I might have missed and/or are not included in this collection.

Happy reading!
